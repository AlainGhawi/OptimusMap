# OptimusMap
Optimal camera distribution within a city based on crimes

🚀 Idea 
Camera Installation Location optimization for crime / traffic monitoring. 

Heatmap of hotspots to recommend to clients their camera installation location within an area, city, or municipality.

☀️ Solution
1. Identify Key Locations:
Major intersections and roads leading to highways.

Areas with high traffic flow and potential escape routes.

Known hotspots for crime and previous incidents.

2. Obtain or Create a Base Map:
Use tools like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or city planning maps.

Ensure the map includes street names, intersections, and major landmarks.

3. Mark Key Areas for Camera Placement:
Use digital mapping tools like GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS) or simpler tools like Google My Maps.

4. Consider Strategic Camera Placement:
Cover all entry and exit points at the intersection.

Place cameras at adjacent intersections and along major roads leading to highways.

Ensure coverage of both pedestrian and vehicle traffic.
