## 🚀Idea 

In order to ensure the safety in a city, we need the surveillance camera locations to be optimal for crime/traffic monitoring. 
Hence, we came up with the idea of generating a layer on top of a base map to suggest/recommend the optimal locations.

1. Identify Key Locations:
   - Major intersections and roads leading to highways.
   - Areas with high traffic flow and potential escape routes.
   - Known hotspots for crime and previous incidents.

2. Obtain or Create a Base Map:
   - Use tools like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or city planning maps.

   Ensure the map includes street names, intersections, and major landmarks.

3. Mark Key Areas for Camera Placement:
   - Use digital mapping tools like GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS) or simpler tools like Google My Maps.

4. Consider Strategic Camera Placement:
   - Cover all entry and exit points at the intersection.
   - Place cameras at adjacent intersections and along major roads leading to highways.
   - Ensure coverage of both pedestrian and vehicle traffic.
